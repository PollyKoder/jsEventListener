                <!-- Change the letter with js to make it show "WASD" and have each click activate with the "WASD" buttons, can I do this? -->
                <!--When the button is clicked with mouse -> alert: use your keyboard please-->
                <!-- another idea: have another button pop up after "D" that says "What game am I?" as user clicks the button it turns into a input box
                where the user can write an answer that is stored in local storage(?) while the background turns into a dark space theme, if 
                user types in correct answer it will "unlock" a brighter space theme and a gif og the protagonist from the game. Can I make a soft animation 
                on the input field that removes the writing while it flashes/blinks red if input is wrong and does the same but is green if the input is correct-->

                <!-- additional function if time: make it so the gif gets a faded over image of the character jumping if user 
                 presses the "space" button on the keyboard -->
